			<h1>SOLAR SYSTEM SIMULATION</h1>

			<p>This simulation shows the orbital periods between each planet. This is an accurate simulation of orbital periods for each planet relative to each other. A year is defined as 
			the length of time a planet takes to complete one full rotation around the sun. Here, 
			it is easy to see that as distance from the sun increases, so does the orbital period.
			The orbital period for each planet is as follows: </p>

			<u1 id="orbital"> 
				<li>Mercury: 87.97 days (0.2 years) </li>
				<li>Venus : 224.70 days (0.6 years)</li>
				<li>Earth: 365.26 days(1 year)</li>
				<li>Mars: 686.98 days(1.9 years)</li>
				<li>Jupiter: 4,332.82 days (11.9 years)</li>
				<li>Saturn: 10,755.70 days (29.5 years)</li>
				<li>Uranus: 30,687.15 days (84 years)</li>
				<li>Neptune: 60,190.03 days (164.8 years)</li>

	    		<h1>DEEP SPACE</h1>
	    		<p>Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence of each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108â€“1012 per m3.</p>
